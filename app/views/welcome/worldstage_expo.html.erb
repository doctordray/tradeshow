            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
            WorldStage Expo is an Australian owned company.  We are a husband and wife team who, along with our IT specialists, believe in providing our clients with the best possible service and promoting their business to a world-wide audience.
            </p>

            <p>
            We established WorldStage Expo for two reasons.  Our first goal is to assist expo organisers and businesses that attend expos reach a wider audience.  Not only do we look forward to assisting in the promotion of many successful expos, our other key goal is to be able to "give a bit back" and make a difference to the world. With this end goal in mind, it is our intention is to donate a percentage of the profits of every online tradeshow, fair and expo to a charity relevant to the industry represented.
            </p>

            <p>
            We look forward to working with you.
